# 🧠 Aiser Platform - Cursor AI Development Guide

## The Cursor Hack That Changes Everything

After building 8 projects with Cursor AI, I found one trick that changed everything:

### The Problem
- Cursor loses context after ~10 messages
- You re-explain your entire project structure daily
- It suggests changes that break existing features
- Your blood pressure rises with each "undefined variable"

### The Fix That Saved My Sanity
**Create a markdown file: `aiser-platform-context.md`**  
**Add this to your `.cursorrules`:**

```
IMPORTANT:
Always read aiser-platform-context.md before writing any code.
After major features, update aiser-platform-context.md.
Document the entire database schema here.
Add new migrations to the same file.
```

## 🎯 What Goes in the File

### Complete Database Schema
```sql
-- All tables with relationships
-- Indexes and constraints
-- Migration history
-- Data types and defaults
```

### API Endpoints and Their Purposes
```typescript
// All endpoints with request/response schemas
// Authentication requirements
// Error handling patterns
// Rate limiting rules
```

### Key Business Logic Rules
```typescript
// AI analysis confidence scoring
// Data source connection validation
// Dashboard permission controls
// Widget limits and constraints
```

### Current Feature Status
```markdown
- ✅ Completed features
- 🔄 In progress features
- 📋 Planned features
- 🚨 Known issues
```

### Known Issues/Constraints
```markdown
- Memory management requirements
- Performance optimization needs
- Security considerations
- Scalability limitations
```

## 🚀 This File is Your Team's Shared Brain

### Benefits
- **No Context Loss**: Cursor always knows the current state
- **Consistent Development**: Everyone follows the same patterns
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers understand everything quickly
- **Reduced Errors**: Less breaking changes and undefined variables
- **Better Collaboration**: Team members stay in sync

### How to Use
1. **Before coding**: Always read `aiser-platform-context.md`
2. **During development**: Reference it for patterns and rules
3. **After features**: Update it with new information
4. **Team sync**: Use it for standups and planning

## 🔧 Cursor Rules Implementation

### The `.cursorrules` File
Contains comprehensive rules for:
- Project architecture and structure
- Database schema and operations
- API endpoints and patterns
- Frontend component patterns
- AI integration rules
- Security and performance requirements
- Known issues and solutions

### The `aiser-platform-context.md` File
Contains current project state:
- Complete database schema
- All API endpoints
- Current feature status
- Known issues and solutions
- Recent changes and updates
- Business logic rules
- Performance metrics

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Before Writing Code
1. **Read `aiser-platform-context.md`** - Understand current state
2. **Check `.cursorrules`** - Follow development patterns
3. **Review existing code** - Look for similar implementations
4. **Plan your changes** - Consider impact on existing features

### During Development
1. **Follow the patterns** - Use established component patterns
2. **Implement error handling** - Use ErrorBoundary and LoadingStates
3. **Optimize performance** - Use memory-optimized components
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no breaking changes

### After Completing Work
1. **Update `aiser-platform-context.md`** - Document new features
2. **Add new API endpoints** - Update API documentation
3. **Update database schema** - Document schema changes
4. **Test all integrations** - Ensure everything works together

## 🧠 AI Integration Best Practices

### Cursor AI Context Management
- **Always reference the context file** before making changes
- **Update the context file** after major features
- **Keep it current** - Outdated context leads to errors
- **Document everything** - Database schema, API endpoints, business logic

### Development Patterns
```typescript
// Error Handling Pattern
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ComplexComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>

// Loading States Pattern
{loading ? <QueryLoading message="Executing..." /> : <Results />}

// Memory Optimization Pattern
<MemoryOptimizedEditor
  value={sqlQuery}
  onChange={handleChange}
  options={optimizedOptions}
/>
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Development Efficiency
- **Context Loss**: Reduced from daily to never
- **Onboarding Time**: Reduced from days to hours
