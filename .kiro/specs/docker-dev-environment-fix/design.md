# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the Docker development environment issues by implementing a robust, self-healing development setup with comprehensive error handling, dependency management optimization, and enhanced debugging capabilities. The solution focuses on improving the existing `scripts/dev.sh` script and Docker configurations to provide a reliable development experience.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Development Script** (`scripts/dev.sh`)
   - Improved prerequisite checking with auto-recovery
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Dependency validation and caching strategies
   - Service health monitoring and verification

2. **Optimized Docker Configurations**
   - Multi-stage builds with dependency caching
   - Health checks with proper timeouts
   - Volume management for persistent caches
   - Network isolation and port conflict resolution

3. **Environment Management System**
   - Automatic `.env` file creation from template
   - Environment variable validation
   - Default value provisioning
   - Configuration drift detection

4. **Monitoring and Logging Framework**
   - Structured logging with service identification
   - Real-time health status reporting
   - Error aggregation and reporting
   - Performance metrics collection

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Development Script Interface

```bash
# Core commands with improved reliability

```typescript
interface BuildConfig {
  service: string;
  dockerfile: string;
  context: string;
  buildArgs: Record<string, string>;
  cacheStrategy: 'aggressive' | 'conservative' | 'none';
}
```

### Environment Configuration
```typescript
interface EnvConfig {
  required: string[];
  optional: Record<string, string>;
  validation: Record<string, (value: string) => boolean>;
  secrets: string[];
}
```
