# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current development environment setup using `scripts/dev.sh` is failing, particularly with Docker processes and dependency installation. This feature aims to create a robust, reliable development environment setup that handles common Docker and dependency issues, provides clear error messages, and ensures consistent development experience across different environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development script to successfully start all Docker services, so that I can begin development without manual troubleshooting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `./scripts/dev.sh docker` THEN the system SHALL successfully build and start all Docker containers
2. WHEN Docker containers fail to build THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific failure point
3. WHEN dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback strategies and provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN services start successfully THEN the system SHALL verify all health checks pass before reporting success

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive dependency management in Docker containers, so that all required packages are properly installed and cached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds to optimize dependency installation
2. WHEN Poetry dependencies fail to install THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and suggested fixes
3. WHEN Node.js dependencies fail to install THEN the system SHALL clear cache and retry with verbose logging
4. WHEN containers restart THEN the system SHALL reuse cached dependencies to speed up startup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic environment validation and setup, so that missing prerequisites are detected and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the development script THEN the system SHALL validate all required tools are installed
2. WHEN Docker is not running THEN the system SHALL provide instructions to start Docker
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL create them with sensible defaults
4. WHEN ports are already in use THEN the system SHALL detect conflicts and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that common issues are automatically resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers fail to start THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery strategies
2. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL wait for database readiness with timeout
3. WHEN build cache is corrupted THEN the system SHALL clear cache and rebuild
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide network troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL provide real-time logs with timestamps and service identification
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support verbose mode with additional diagnostic information
4. WHEN services are healthy THEN the system SHALL display service status and access URLs
