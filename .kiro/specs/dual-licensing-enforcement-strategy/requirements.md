# Dual Licensing and Technical Enforcement Strategy Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive dual licensing strategy with technical enforcement mechanisms for the Aiser Platform. The strategy will enable open source community engagement while protecting commercial intellectual property through legal and technical gates, similar to successful models used by Superset, GitLab, and other dual-licensed platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Legal Framework and License Structure

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want a clear legal framework that separates open source and commercial components, so that I can build community engagement while protecting commercial value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I structure the repository THEN I SHALL have per-package LICENSE files with clear open source (MIT) and commercial licensing
2. WHEN contributors submit code THEN I SHALL have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that grants re-licensing rights
3. WHEN I document licensing THEN I SHALL have clear README sections explaining the dual licensing model
4. WHEN I publish packages THEN I SHALL have explicit license headers in all source files
5. WHEN I handle legal compliance THEN I SHALL have automated license scanning and validation in CI/CD

### Requirement 2: Technical Enforcement Through License Key Validation

**User Story:** As a commercial software vendor, I want robust license key validation that prevents unauthorized use of enterprise features, so that I can monetize premium capabilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enterprise packages initialize THEN I SHALL validate license keys against an entitlement service
2. WHEN license validation fails THEN I SHALL gracefully degrade to open source functionality or display warnings
3. WHEN I manage licenses THEN I SHALL have centralized license management with usage tracking and analytics
4. WHEN I deploy enterprise features THEN I SHALL have offline license validation with periodic online verification

5. WHEN I monitor usage THEN I SHALL have analytics on feature adoption and usage patterns by tier

### Requirement 5: Architectural Separation and Plugin System

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want clean separation between open source core and commercial extensions, so that the architecture supports both community development and commercial innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I design the architecture THEN I SHALL have open source core with well-defined extension points and APIs
2. WHEN I develop commercial features THEN I SHALL implement them as plugins that register with the core system
3. WHEN I manage dependencies THEN I SHALL ensure open source core functions independently without commercial components
4. WHEN I create extension points THEN I SHALL have comprehensive plugin SDK with hooks for UI, data processing, and integrations
5. WHEN I validate architecture THEN I SHALL have automated tests ensuring core functionality works without commercial plugins

### Requirement 6: Code Ownership and Contribution Management

**User Story:** As an open source maintainer, I want clear code ownership and contribution guidelines, so that I can manage community contributions while protecting commercial interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I manage contributions THEN I SHALL have CODEOWNERS file that automatically assigns reviewers based on changed files
2. WHEN contributors submit PRs THEN I SHALL have automated CLA checking and signing workflow
3. WHEN I review contributions THEN I SHALL have clear guidelines distinguishing open source vs commercial code areas
4. WHEN I accept contributions THEN I SHALL ensure contributors understand licensing implications and grant necessary rights
5. WHEN I manage repository access THEN I SHALL have separate teams for open source and enterprise components

### Requirement 7: Compliance and Audit Framework

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and compliance reporting, so that I can ensure licensing compliance and support legal requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I audit licensing THEN I SHALL have automated scanning of all dependencies and license compatibility
2. WHEN I track usage THEN I SHALL have comprehensive logs of license validation attempts and feature access
3. WHEN I generate reports THEN I SHALL have compliance dashboards showing license status and usage patterns
4. WHEN I investigate violations THEN I SHALL have detailed audit trails of all license-related activities
5. WHEN I manage legal requirements THEN I SHALL have automated alerts for license expiration and compliance issues

### Requirement 8: Customer Onboarding and License Management

**User Story:** As a sales engineer, I want streamlined customer onboarding with automated license provisioning, so that I can quickly deploy enterprise customers and manage their subscriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I onboard customers THEN I SHALL have automated license generation and delivery system
2. WHEN I manage subscriptions THEN I SHALL have customer portal for license management and usage monitoring
3. WHEN I provision access THEN I SHALL have role-based license assignment with team management capabilities
