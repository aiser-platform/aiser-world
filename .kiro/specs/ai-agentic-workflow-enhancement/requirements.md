# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the enhancement of Aiser's AI Agentic Workflow to create a world-class, end-to-end AI-native analytics platform that **democratizes data analysis for every employee**. The system will transform natural language input into actionable business insights, executive reports, and automated recommendations, making every employee "data capable" regardless of their technical background.

The enhancement will consolidate existing AI services, evaluate and optimize the current AI orchestrator, implement zero-trust security, apply zero data copy principles, and assess the LangChain + LiteLLM architecture for optimal performance and accuracy.

The goal is to create an autonomous AI system that handles the complete data analysis lifecycle: natural language query → SQL execution → chart rendering → actionable insights → executive reporting → automated recommendations, all through an intuitive chat interface that any employee can use effectively.
