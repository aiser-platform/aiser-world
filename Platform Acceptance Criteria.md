# Platform Acceptance Criteria: Overview of Architecture and Functionality

**Goal:** This document provides a clear overview of how the system should work across different layers of the platform: **Frontend**, **Backend**, **API**, **Database**, and **Tech Architecture**. The document also outlines the acceptance criteria for each component to ensure that everything functions correctly.

---

## 1) Frontend (Client-Side)

### Expected Functionality:
- The frontend will be built using **Next.js** and will provide an interactive UI for visualizing data in the form of charts.
- **Dynamic Data Display**: The frontend must update charts in real-time based on backend responses or user interactions.
- Users should be able to input data or upload files, and the frontend will send that data to the backend for processing.
- **Natural Language Query**: Users can query the data using natural language, and the frontend should be able to display the results dynamically.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Dynamic Visualization**: Charts must update in real-time when new data is inputted or queried by the user.
2. **Error Handling**: Errors (e.g., invalid inputs or server issues) should be displayed clearly to the user.
3. **Data Query**: Users can ask questions about the data, and the frontend should display relevant visualizations.
4. **Responsive UI**: The frontend must be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## 2) Backend (Server-Side)

### Expected Functionality:
- The backend will be built using **FastAPI** and will handle incoming requests from the frontend.
- It will process data (e.g., user input, chart generation) and interact with the database.
- The backend will handle **authentication** via JWT tokens and enforce user authorization for specific resources.
- It will also include AI models or algorithms to process and generate charts.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Input Validation**: The backend should validate all incoming data using **Pydantic** models to ensure data integrity and security.
2. **Data Processing**: The backend must process user requests (e.g., data queries, chart generation) and send back relevant results.
3. **Authentication**: Ensure users are authenticated via **JWT** tokens. All sensitive endpoints should require valid authentication.
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for internal server errors) must be returned to the frontend.

## 3) API (Frontend and Backend Communication)

### Expected Functionality:
- The frontend and backend will communicate using **RESTful APIs**.
- The backend will expose endpoints for the frontend to interact with, such as **chart generation**, **data query**, and **user authentication**.
- API responses should be returned in **JSON** format, making it easy for the frontend to parse and render the data.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Endpoint Availability**: All required API endpoints must be available and functional for the frontend to interact with.
2. **Data Format**: The backend must return data in a standardized JSON format for easy parsing on the frontend.
3. **Security**: All sensitive API endpoints should require **JWT authentication** and enforce proper access control.
4. **Error Handling**: The API should return appropriate error responses (e.g., 400 for invalid input, 500 for server errors).

---

## 4) Database (Data Storage and Management)

### Expected Functionality:
- The database should store user data, input data, and chart generation results.
- It will support flexible data storage, potentially using **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**, depending on the systemâ€™s needs.
- **Relational** or **NoSQL** databases can be used for storing dynamic data that varies based on user input.
- The database schema should support efficient querying and data retrieval for chart generation and analytics.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Data Integrity**: The database should validate and store data consistently, ensuring that inputs are properly saved and accessible for querying.
2. **Flexible Data Model**: The database schema should be designed to support dynamic inputs, especially for user-provided data.
3. **Query Performance**: Database queries should return data in a timely manner, supporting fast access to data for chart generation.
4. **Security**: Sensitive data should be encrypted and access should be controlled via user roles and permissions.

---

## 5) Tech Architecture

### Expected Functionality:
- The platform architecture will be built around **modular components**: frontend, backend, API, database, and shared services.
- **Microservices** or a **modular monolith** approach will be used to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- **CI/CD** pipelines will ensure that code changes are automatically tested and deployed across different environments (dev, stage, prod).

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Scalability**: The architecture should support horizontal scaling to handle increased user demand.
2. **Reliability**: The platform should have high availability and be fault-tolerant to avoid downtime (e.g., using load balancing, backup systems).
3. **Observability**: Implement monitoring (e.g., **Prometheus**, **Grafana**) for logging, metrics, and traces to ensure the platform is running optimally.
4. **Security**: Implement best practices for securing each layer of the architecture (e.g., data encryption, secure API endpoints, authentication mechanisms).

---

### **Next Steps Recommendations:**
1. Implement **real-time data handling** on the frontend to ensure interactive and dynamic charts.
2. Enhance **backend processing** to efficiently handle complex data queries and integrate AI models for chart generation.
3. Improve **API documentation** (using **Swagger/OpenAPI**) to ensure clear and easy integration between frontend and backend teams.
4. Optimize **database schema** for flexible data storage and fast query performance.
5. Set up **unit and integration testing** across frontend, backend, and database layers to ensure reliable functionality.
